vcpkg: freetype-gl
- portfile assumes .lib, in order to install on linux, had to change to .a
- (orbitprofiler/external/vcpkg/ports/freetype-gl/portfile.cmake)
- fix and submit pull request!?

freeglut, freetype-gl are taken from debug directory... should be release.  Find a way to find_library not in debug.


Freetype-gl
- make sure libfreetype.a does not exist in vcpkg installed, we need to link with the system .so version, not the .a.
- make sure libglew.a does not exist so that we link the system .so

Required system libs:
libGL.so.1
libfreetype.so.6
libGLEW.so.2.0

CMakeLists
- a cleanup is required...

"bpftrace -l uprobe" seems to output duplicates

// Make sure application is compiled with -fno-omit-frame-pointer for meaningful callstacks
SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -fno-omit-frame-pointer")

REMOTE
- Send clock/platform of incoming data
-- Windows instance should be able to handle local captures and remote captures from Linux
-- See Profiling.h, MicroSecondsFromTicks
